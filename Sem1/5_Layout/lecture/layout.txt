Notable stuff:
- Display:
 + inline: size is the size of the content layout in on the line, cannot change its attributes in vertical axis.
 + block: take the whole line layout as a block, attributes (top, bottom, left, right) can be changed
 (you can even make it on the same line as an inline, block)
 + inline-block: both inline and block (or can be understood as 
 able-to-change-vertical-axis inline, priotize inline)
 + flexbox: 
   > justtify-content: used for the horizontal axe.
   (properties: flex-start, flex-end, center; space-between, space-around,
   space-evenly)
   (space between, space around, space-evenly are different)
   > flex-direction: used to change the default direction of the flexbox
   (properties: column, row, reverse row/column)
   > align-items: used for the vertical axe.
   (properties: flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline?, center)
   > align-content: modifying the spaces between the lines of the box,
   doesn't affect the objects.
   (properties: center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly, flex-end, flex-start)
   > flex-basis, flex shrink: modifying the width of the element "box" according to
   the direction of the main axis (default: horizontal)
   (it will be priotized over the "width" property)
   
 + Grid: 
   > grid-template-column/row: defining the grid length/width in a grid
   (width of nth column/row, separated by spaces)
   > grid-row/column-gap: gap between the rows/columns
   > grid-row/column-start: a (n-1) number of rows/columns will be covered 

Upcoming final tests:
- A website with 5 pages 
- 5 js implementations
