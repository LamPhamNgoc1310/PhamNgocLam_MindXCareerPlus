Actually lesson 7

Notable stuff:
- Responsiveness is necessary in any website
    so that it can adapt to multiple types of devices.
    + Responsiveness VS adaptivness:
        > adaptivness is faster and brings an overall better experience
        for users, how ever it costs more time to create another app than 
        just creating a another format for the same app (Responsiveness)
- Media queries can be used to detect the type of device being used
    + The unit viewheight (vh) based on the device to calculate the
  respodning height.
    + First way:
    mediatype: all | screen | speech | print
    mediafeature: the condition
    use the below to condition:

        "@media not | only mediatype and (mediafeature: value) {
        CSS-code;
        }"

    + Breakpoints is the resolutions for common devices

    + Second way: use class (cannot use until JavaScript)
    The priority order: important > inline css > internal css > 
    e.g: 
        .uiMobile {
            background-color: red;
        }

        .uiDesktop {
            background-color: green;
        }
