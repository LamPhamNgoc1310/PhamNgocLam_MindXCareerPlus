Actual lesson: 10

Notable stuff:
- Looping in js is pretty similar to C (might check out other methods
or functions)
- Array:
 + Array manipulation:
  > Indexing: arr[0] will take the first element
  > Inputing an element: 
   - arr.push(value): append the value to the end of the Array
   - arr.pop(): will remove the last element
   - arr.unshift(value): add the value to the start of the Array
   - arr.shift(): remove the first element
   - arr.concat(targetedArray): merge arrays together
   - arr.slice(start, end): slice a part of the array.
- Object:
 + Object is a reference data type (which means it is saved in
 a specific address in memory)
 + Object in js is different from other OOP languages, instead
 of delcaring a class then use that class to create objects, in JS,
 you declare the object directly.
 + Object is declared through keys and values
 + To access the elements in the array, use "object.key"
 + The for [key] in [object] loop:
  > to access the keys, use this loop
  > to access the values, use dynamic key, object(key)
- Referencing in arrays: 
 + Array in JavaScript is an OBJECT if you make the "=" operation between 2 arrays, then what are "equal" is
 their addresses (which are the same), so whenever the data in 1 arrays get
 some changes, the data in the second one will also change.
