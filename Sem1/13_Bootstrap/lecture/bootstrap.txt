 "Hoisting" in web dev doesn't with "let" and "const", if you use
 these 2 keywords they will only be used where they are declare.
 While for "var", hoisting works
- String formatting can be done with '${}' sign
- CDN link of Bootstrap.
 + this is a link containing the css attributes (that you
 have to link in your html file)
 + this an external library that builds for you all the necessities for an html file.
 + there are keywords that you add in the "class" attribute for these boostraps
 to work.
  > e.g: "btn" to automatically style your button
  "mb" to automatically adjust your margin-bottom attribute.
- Tailwindcss is another better and faster than Boostrap library.
