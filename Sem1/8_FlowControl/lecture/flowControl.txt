Actual lesson: 9
Notable stuff:
- The code block is some lines of code that are limited
by {parentheses} (also called a block scope)
- If you declare a variable using "const" or "let", it will be used inside
only in a scope
- "Switch-case" is another type of condition, it can be used in some circumstances
- for loop and while loop are pretty much the same like in C.
