- To modify the fonts to your liking, you can use the <style> tag (or attribute)
every <html> has this attribute.
- In line CSS refers to a "style" attribute in a tag (rarely use).
- You need to create a .css file (external css) to ensure that the code is lookable according to
"DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)"
 + Internal CSS refers to <style>
- You can label tags with #id (for unique things) and .class (for a group of elements)
- "flex" attribute is important (next lesson)
- Box model: Border, width, height, margin, padding:
 + These are the attribute of an html block.
 + Border is the line surrounding the block.
 + Margin does not affect the block and other blocks.
 + Padding is an invisible border.
- Father and children inheritance:
 + div.[class]
 + div.p.[class]
