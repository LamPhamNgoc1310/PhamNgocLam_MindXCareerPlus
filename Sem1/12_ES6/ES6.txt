Notable stuff:
- What is ES6? 
- Arrow function is a shorter way to declare a function.
 + Instead of declaring a whole function with "function myFunc(){}",
 you can use const myFunc = () => {//logical codes//} myFunc()
 + "=>" works the same as "return ..."
 + How to declare? 
  > 1st: const <name> = (parameters) => { //codes ... return ...}
  function's codes and then returns sth
  > 2nd: const <name> = (parameters) => {return sth, e.g(a-b)}
  function returns sth immediately
  > 3rd: const <name> = (parameters) => ({object})
  function returns an object
- Template literal:
 + You can use "+" operator to concatenate multiple strings.
 +  This is another way to concatenate.
 Starts with a pair of single quotes (`...`) and it helps concatenate many lines
 together. It also supports adding a variable in the string.
- Modules: This divides your program into multiple small sections for 
the ease of management.
 + How? "import {function} from "<path>";

- Spread and Rest operator
 + Spread can help you interact with objects and arrays,
 you can also make elements of a variable flat out (like this: [2,4,6,8]).
  > you can do this by adding "..." before your variable in console.log() or any
  declaration.
 + Rest operator: allows you to input an infinite amount of arguments (parameters)
 into the function delcaration.

- Destructuring:
 + Allows you to take out value of an objects more easily.
  > before, you usually did it like this:
    const person = {name: "MindX", age: 20}
    const name = person.name;
    const age = person.age;

    const coordinate = [0, 1, 1];
    const x = coordinate[0];
    const y = coordinate[1];
    const z = coordinate[2];
  > now, you can do it like this:
    const person = {name: "MindX", age: 7}
    const {name, age} = person;

    const coordinate = [0, 1, 1];
    const [x, y, z] = coordinate;

- Array functions:
 + map function like in python.
 + filter function
- Reduce method:
 +
