Notable Stuff:
- You can use the attribute name and then code the variable
respective to the top-right-bottom-left
 + e.g: padding: 50px 40px 30px 20px
 (when you leave 1 spot blank, it will be understood as vertical-horizontal)
- Position:
 + relative: change the position "relative" to the box position
 (if you don't add postion: relative, the box will simply be "static" by default)
 + absolute: it will be affected by the nearest "father" class with "position: absolute",
 treat it as its box.
 + fixed: the box will be "fixed" (lol)
