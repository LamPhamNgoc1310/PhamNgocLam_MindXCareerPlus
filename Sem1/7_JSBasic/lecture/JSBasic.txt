Actual lesson: 8

Notable stuff:
- JavaScript is a high-level language and it's OOP
    + JS is an EDP (Event-drive programming) lanuage since it requires the
    events/ interactions of the users and execute the logical steps.
    + The <script> tag
    + The console.log is for printing, it can also do simple arithmetics
        (!) You should not put the <script> tag in the header tag, because 
        if it encounters an error, your website will be dropped and it's advisible
        to put it at the end of the site.
    + Variables:
        > Use "let ..."  to initialize a variable, or "var".
        > You cannot start a variable name with a number.
        > Primitive Datatypes are the built-in ones, Reference Datatypes
- Operaions:
    + There are also Primitive Operaions, String Operaions, Comparison Operations and 
    Logical Operaions in JS
    + Some other new things:
        > "===" is used to compare the datatypes of variables
