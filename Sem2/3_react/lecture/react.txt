Notable stuff:
- We are studying about React.js, first we gotta install it along with Node.js.
- We use React to better and faster construct our code
- Vite is a translation tool that will compile the React "code" to html.
- In the second step, we will need to create a new project with the command "npm create vite@latest"
 + You will proceed as instructed by the terminal.
 + "npm install"
 + "npm run dev" to see basic control of your project website.
- You will focus on the "src" folder in the project directory.
 + The file has an unique file extension "jsx" which allow us to include html in js files.
 (In theory, the code in jsx is compiled into js (i.e DOM))
 + The code will be run in 'main.jsx', notice that we have to import all the files in there,
 these file can be used if you call them as <Tag></Tag>
 + if you want to declare a class, you can use the 'className=""' attribute.
- You can also input parameters to avoid repetition looking kinda like 
 "function foo(parameter) {parameter.name, parameter.value}"
