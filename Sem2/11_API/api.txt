Note:
- then() method: to access the returned result of Promise when it's fulfilled.
- json(): taking the result from an API, this is a Promise, so if you want to see its result, you have to use .then() again
- Asynchronous: tasks are executed at their designated timeout.
- Synchronous: tasks are executed sequentially if you nest functions in side functions.
- Promise (ES6): 
 + it's a cascading sequence of returning and taking parameters.
 + .then() will take the returned result of ONLY the previous function.
 + .finally() will always runs
 + .catch() will catch errors.
