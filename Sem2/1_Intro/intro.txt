Actual lesson: 1
Notable stuff:
- This course will focus on ReactJS.
- "Array" is a new data type in this course, array is also an object.
- A normal function will be declared like: "function() {//code//}", but in ES6,
a function can be declared with arrow function: sth = () => {//code//}
- Arrow function:
 + Arrow function doesn't support hoisting.
 + You can have parameters in an arrow function
 like this: 
 const sum = (a,b) => {
    console.log("The sum of 2 numbers is: ")
    return a+b;
 }
 + return an object: const getAddress() => ({city: "Hanoi"})
- Template literal:
 + This is a functionality allowing multi-line strings, concatenation with ` `,...

- Module in js:
 + The <script> will now have access to "type" attribute
- Template literal: 
 + To use a module, you must export it first, each export will have its
 own way to import
  > First way: (this looks like a declaration of an object)
   export {
    function 1,
    function 2,
    function ...,
   };

   import {function1, function2} from "file.js";

   > Second way: export a whole function.
   export const myFunc = (parameter) => {
    //code
   }

   > Third way: export parameters

- Object and array:
 + Array:
  > Already said, you can access array elements with loops
 + Object: 


- forEach loop:
 + this loops through each element of an array

- map function:
 + this loops through each element of an array and return
 a new array.

Fun stuff: 

Feedback: 
- instead of console log can you use inner HTML instead, i think this is
a good way for student to have an intuition with this.
