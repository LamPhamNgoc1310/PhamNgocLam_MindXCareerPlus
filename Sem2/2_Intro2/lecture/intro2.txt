Notable stuff:
REST & SPREAD Operators:
- Spread means to lay out all the elements of an array or an object 
 (note that for objects, elements will be laid out in "key:value" format)
 Syntax: ...(variable)

- Rest means to create a function with an infinite amount of parameters

DESTRUCTURING
- To access and map values of an array or an object to an array or an object.

DATA TYPES
- Primitive: gets compared by values when made to be compared
- References: 
 + Saved on address of memory slot
 + Compared by addresses
 + the addresses are NEVER the same
 + object or array.

 e.g: [1,2] === [1,2] => false (diff in addresses.)
? What if you want to compare the values instead?
- You will have to use JSON.stringyfy() to convert the arrays above to strings and then compare them.

- map() method is used to map values and copy them a new array 
- filter() method is like an if statement that filter the values with specific conditions.
